![agent-overview](https://www.applivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/agent-overview-1024x651.png "agent-overview | Applivery")To extend Android API limitations, Applivery provides an agent app that helps better track device activity including:

-   Geolocation tracking
-   Network traffic
-   Apps usage

Applivery Android MDM Agent is an Android App written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) that is **deployed at the Policy level** to report device usage from time to time, depending on the type of subscription you have.

## Features

### Geolocation tracking

![agent-geolocation](https://www.applivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-115513-1024x651.png "agent-geolocation | Applivery")

Reports device geolocation (latitude, longitude) including full street address when available. You can see the entire list of locations reported from the dashboard by going to **Devices > (Select an Android device) > Locations**. Click each line from the list to display the map preview and click Open to open the location in Google Maps.

Note The geolocation report is available for **fully managed** devices and **COPE** (Company-Owned, Personally Enabled) devices.  
Devices with a **work profile** do not have access to this feature.

### Apps usage reporting

![apps-usage-report](https://www.applivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apps-usage-report-1024x685.png "apps-usage-report | Applivery")

Reports apps usage time by querying foreground activities from Android API’s. Usage analytics will be displayed by the App on a weekly basis. We aggregate usage times by package name, providing also the App name and category when available. The top 5 applications will be colored in different colors for better identification. The rest of the usage time will be aggregated in gray.

To access the reports analytics, go to **Devices > (Select an Android device) > Usage > Screen time**, then use the selector located above the charts to move across weeks.

Note Personal apps will not be visible for devices with a **work profile** or **COPE** (Company-Owned, Personally Enabled) devices; **only work apps will be reported**.  
For **fully managed** devices, all apps will be visible.

### Network traffic

![network-traffic-report](https://www.applivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/network-traffic-report-1024x685.png "network-traffic-report | Applivery")

Reports app’s incoming and outgoing network traffic in Mb by querying network usage Android API’s. Network analytics will be displayed by the App on a weekly basis. We aggregate network usage by package name, providing also the App name and category when available. The top 5 applications will be colored in different colors for better identification. The rest of the usage time will be aggregated in gray.

To access the reports analytics, go to **Devices > (Select an Android device) > Usage > Network**, then use the selector located above the charts to move across weeks. You can use the blue selectors to limit the content and only see WiFi or Mobile traffic or to distinguish between Received and Transmitted network traffic.

### Features by plan

Advanced Plan

Geolocation tracking

Sync frequency: every 1h.  
Retention: 1 week.

Sync frequency: every 15 minutes.  
Retention: 1 month.

Network traffic

Sync frequency: every 24h.  
Retention: 1 week.

Sync frequency: every 12h.  
Retention: 1 month.

Apps usage

Sync frequency: every 12h.  
Retention: 1 month.

Note Please note that the Agent app will adhere to the sync frequency indicated in the table above.  
However, **the system may prioritize other processes** depending on factors such as network connection status, battery optimizations, or doze mode.Note Android includes a **battery optimization system and background execution limits** designed to reduce battery consumption by restricting apps from running freely in the background unless they have been granted a specific **background execution** permission by the user.  
However, **some device manufacturers customize Android and may remove this permission or its associated settings screen**, making it appear as if the permission is missing. In such cases, **there is no need to worry** — the Agent will still function correctly. Since the system limitation does not apply on those devices, the app can run in the background seamlessly, **as if the permission had already been granted**. ×

## We keep your data secure and private

At Applivery we take data security very seriously, even more so when it comes to sensitive data from users’ devices. That’s why Applivery Android MDM Agent uses the best-in-class encryption algorithms to end-to-end protect transmitted data. All tracking reports are encrypted at runtime using **SHA-256** cryptographic hash while they are also protected in transit using SSL TLS 1.3. Once in our servers, your data is also encrypted at rest using **SHA-256**.

## Enabling the Agent at policy level

Applivery Device Management Android Agent is enabled at the Policy level. Go to your Android policies from **Device Management > Policies**. You can use the top filter to just show the Android policies. Click one of them and go to the **Agent section** (1) from the left side menu.

![enable-android-agent](https://www.applivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-120052-1024x651.png "enable-android-agent | Applivery")

To enable the Android Agent, click the **Enable** button located at the top right (2).

Last, decide whether you want the agent to be installed in **Required for Setup** mode. This way is the most common for new devices, and the app will be installed during the enrollment process to ensure it’s installed before the system starts up.

If you don’t select this option, the application will be installed in **Force Installed** mode, which is the most common scenario, and the agent app will be automatically installed on the devices and cannot be removed.

Don’t forget to click Save changes button before leaving the page to deploy all your changes.

Note Please note that once saved, the Android Agent will be deployed on all your devices associated with that Policy. However, **it will not start reporting until it's opened at least once** and explicit access permissions are accepted.

### How to programatically launch the agent from your workflow

As mentioned before, the Applivery Android Agent requires to be opened at least once to get the appropriate permissions and start reporting. Sometimes you may need to programatically launch it from your enrollment process or another app.

To launch Applivery Agent you need to **invoke it with an Intent** with the following action:

`com.applivery.mdm_agent.action.LAUNCH`

To ensure that the agent is available at runtime you may need first to query system information about it such as calling:

```
val intent = Intent("com.applivery.mdm_agent.action.LAUNCH")
if (packageManager.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0).isNotEmpty()) {
    startActivity(intent)
}
```

```
<manifest package="com.example.app">
    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="com.applivery.mdm_agent.action.LAUNCH" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
    ...
</manifest>
```
