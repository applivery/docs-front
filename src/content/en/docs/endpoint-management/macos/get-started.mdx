<h1>Unlock Android Device Management with Applivery: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

<p>Ready to streamline your Android device management? This guide walks you through setting up <strong>Android Enterprise</strong> with Applivery, connecting your organization to Google's powerful management infrastructure. This integration allows you to securely deploy apps, enforce policies, and maintain control over your entire Android device fleet.</p>

<p>Before you can leverage Applivery's Android Device Management features, you'll need to complete this registration process, establishing a secure link between your organization and Google's Android Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) services.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Google Account for Android Enterprise</h2>

<p>Selecting the appropriate Google account type is crucial for a successful Android Enterprise setup. Your choice will determine the configuration of your environment and the features available to you.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Google Workspace (Managed Domain) - Recommended for Enterprises</h3>

<p>If your organization utilizes <strong>Google Workspace</strong> (formerly G Suite), we highly recommend using a managed account associated with your corporate domain (e.g., <code>yourname@yourcompany.com</code>). This option provides the deepest integration, centralized control, and scalability for managing your Android devices.</p>

<h4>Prerequisites for Google Workspace Integration:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Administrator Privileges:</strong> The account must be a <strong>Super Admin</strong> in Google Workspace with authorization to enable EMM integrations.</li>
    <li><strong>Domain Verification:</strong> Your domain must be fully <strong>verified</strong> within Google Workspace.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party EMM Integration:</strong> You must <strong>enable third-party EMM integration</strong> from the Google Admin Console.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enabling this integration empowers Applivery to manage devices, enforce policies, and distribute applications through Managed Google Play on behalf of your organization. The following sections will guide you through configuring each of these requirements.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Gmail (Unmanaged Account) - Suitable for Small Teams and Testing</h3>

<p>Alternatively, you can register your Android Enterprise setup using a personal <strong>Gmail account</strong> (e.g., <code>yourname@gmail.com</code>). This method offers a faster and simpler setup process, eliminating the need for domain verification. However, it comes with limitations.</p>

<p>This approach is best suited for smaller teams, testing environments, or organizations that do not use Google Workspace. While it lacks advanced features like domain-based app publishing and granular user management, it still enables basic Android Device Management through Applivery.</p>

<h2>Configuring Google Workspace for Android Enterprise: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<p>If you've chosen to use a <strong>Google Workspace</strong> (managed domain) account, follow these steps to ensure your domain is properly configured for seamless integration with Applivery.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Verify Your Domain in Google Workspace</h3>

<p>Before linking your organization to Android Enterprise, ensure your domain is verified in Google Workspace. Log in to the <a href="https://admin.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Admin Console</a> using a Super Admin account.</p>

<p>From the Admin Console dashboard, navigate to <strong>Domains > Manage Domains</strong>. If your domain is not yet verified, follow Google's instructions to verify it by adding a DNS record or uploading an HTML file.</p>

<p>Domain verification confirms your organization's identity to Google and unlocks enterprise-level management features, including centralized App Distribution and device policies.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Enable Third-Party EMM Integration</h3>

<p>To grant Applivery permission to manage your devices, you need to enable <strong>third-party EMM integration</strong> within the Google Admin Console.</p>

<p>Navigate to <strong>Devices > Mobile & endpoints > Settings > Third-party integrations</strong>, then select an Organizational Unit (OU). You can configure this setting at the parent level to apply it to all child units or customize it for individual child units as needed.</p>

<p>Enable the option <strong>Enable third-party Android mobile management</strong> to allow Applivery to integrate with Google Play for Work.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assign Admin Roles for Android Enterprise</h3>

<p>The Google account used for the Android Enterprise setup requires the appropriate permissions. If you're not using a Super Admin account, you'll need to assign the necessary role. From the Admin Console, navigate to <strong>Admin roles</strong> and assign a role with the <strong>Mobile Device Management</strong> privileges, or grant full <strong>Super Admin</strong> access for complete control.</p>

<p>Super Admin access is recommended for a smooth setup, ensuring no restrictions during the process.</p>
