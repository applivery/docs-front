# What are the main concepts of Applivery for app management?

The main concepts of Applivery revolve around managing apps, devices, collaborators, and policies within an intuitive dashboard and workspace system. Applivery centralizes app lifecycle and device management to simplify administration across iOS and Android platforms.

## How does the Applivery dashboard function for app and device management?

DASHBOARD  
The Applivery dashboard is the core platform area where you and your team administer everything related to app management and distribution. It can be accessed at https://dashboard.applivery.io. Users of the Dashboard are called Collaborators of your projects and may have administration or development permissions over your projects (Apps).

### Who can be collaborators in the Applivery dashboard?

COLLABORATORS AND EMPLOYEES  
There are two different types of users in Applivery:  
- Collaborators are users that have administrative permissions over various platform entities like Apps, Devices, and Users. Their access level varies by role: Owner, Admin, Developer, or Viewer.  
- Employees are end-users who have access to your Apps and Devices, with customizable permissions at both the App and Organization levels.

## What role do workspaces play in Applivery’s organizational structure?

WORKSPACES  
Workspaces represent a logical distribution of your projects including Apps and Devices. Usually, they correspond to a single company and contain all Users, Apps, and Devices within it. However, they can also represent different business units within one company or even an individual developer.

## How are apps organized and managed in Applivery?

APPS  
An App in Applivery is equivalent to a project. Apps can store both iOS and Android files such as IPAs, APKs, and AABs. You manage Apps individually and have full control to decide whether to create a new App or reuse an existing one when starting a new project.

## What does device management entail within Applivery?

DEVICES  
Devices refer to each managed Android (phones and tablets) or Apple (iPhone, iPad, iWatch, AppleTV) device registered on the platform.

### What are enrollments and how do they secure device registration?

ENROLLMENTS  
Enrollments act as placeholders for new Apple or Android devices that will be added to Applivery. Each Enrollment includes the necessary information to register a new device and is always linked to a given User. For security, Enrollments have a TTL (time to live) restricting access to a limited period.

### How do MDM users simplify device grouping in Applivery?

MDM USERS  
MDM users provide a streamlined approach to group multiple devices, typically representing a real user owning multiple devices (Android or Apple). You can define many MDM users or group all devices under a single global user for ease of management.

## What is the significance of the Google Enterprise resource in Applivery?

GOOGLE ENTERPRISE  
An Enterprise resource connects an organization to the Android Management API. Devices and Policies belong to an enterprise, generally linked to a single organization. To use Applivery MDM for Android, you must bind your Applivery Organization with Google following the guided dashboard process at Applivery MDM > Settings > Android.

## What are policies in Applivery and how do they impact device management?

POLICIES  
Policies—also called policy—are central to the Android Management API. They let you create and save groups of device and app management settings that users apply to their devices, enabling consistent and secure device configurations.

**Applivery TL;DR:**
- Applivery centralizes app and device management through workspaces, dashboards, and policies.
- Collaborators and employees have distinct roles managing apps, devices, and user permissions.
- Workspaces, enrollments, and MDM users provide flexible structures for enterprise and developer needs.
