# Migrate from Meraki SM to Applivery: The Modern MDM Built for Your Future

Cisco Meraki Systems Manager (SM) has reached end-of-sale, with complete service shutdown scheduled for March 31, 2026. Organizations using Meraki SM face a critical decision: where to migrate their device management platform before support ends.

**Applivery offers the fastest, simplest, and most cost-effective migration path from Meraki SM.** With free migration services, deployment in days instead of months, and transparent pricing starting at €2/device/month, Applivery eliminates the complexity and cost typically associated with MDM platform transitions.

This comprehensive guide explains why Applivery is the ideal Meraki SM replacement and provides everything you need to plan and execute a successful migration.

## Why is Cisco discontinuing Meraki SM?

Cisco announced the end-of-sale for Meraki Systems Manager as part of a strategic refocus on core networking and security products. The MDM market has evolved rapidly, with cloud-native platforms like Applivery offering more advanced automation, simpler deployment, and better pricing than legacy solutions.

**Meraki SM end-of-life timeline:**

| Date | Milestone | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **December 31, 2024** | Last date to order new licenses | No new Meraki SM purchases possible |
| **December 31, 2025** | End of support | No security patches or technical support |
| **March 31, 2026** | Service shutdown | Complete loss of device management |

**Organizations must migrate by Q4 2025** to avoid security risks, compliance violations, and complete loss of device management capabilities.

**What happens if you don't migrate:**

- Unpatched security vulnerabilities expose your organization to breaches
- Compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) from unmanaged devices
- No technical support when issues arise
- Complete device management shutdown on March 31, 2026
- Emergency last-minute migration at premium cost

The time to act is **now**. Waiting until 2026 creates unnecessary risk and eliminates your ability to choose the best solution for your needs.

## Why Applivery is the best Meraki SM replacement

Applivery was built from the ground up as a modern, cloud-native Unified Endpoint Management platform that surpasses Meraki SM in every critical dimension.

### 1. Deploy in days, not months

**Meraki SM migration typically takes 6-12 weeks with most platforms.** Applivery reduces this to 2-4 weeks with our streamlined migration process.

**Why Applivery is faster:**

- **Intuitive setup wizard** guides you through configuration in hours
- **Pre-built policy templates** match common Meraki SM configurations
- **Automated device migration tools** streamline the transition
- **Zero-touch enrollment** for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows
- **No complex infrastructure requirements** - fully cloud-native

**Real migration timeline:**

- **Week 1:** Platform setup, policy configuration, identity provider integration
- **Week 2:** Pilot deployment with 50-100 devices, feedback and refinement
- **Week 3-4:** Phased migration of all remaining devices
- **Total:** 2-4 weeks to complete migration vs. 3-6 months with legacy platforms

**Customer results:**
- Manufacturing company (800 devices): **3 weeks total migration time**
- Healthcare organization (2,500 devices): **6 weeks including validation**
- Game studio (1,200 devices): **4 weeks with zero downtime**

### 2. Advanced automation that exceeds Meraki SM

Applivery doesn't just replace Meraki SM—it dramatically improves your device management capabilities with modern automation features.

**Policy Composition - Multiple policies per device**

Meraki SM limitation: 1 policy per device
Applivery capability: **Multiple weighted policies per device**

Assign overlapping policies with priority weighting (1-1000) for granular control:
- **Policy 1 (weight: 900):** Company-wide security restrictions
- **Policy 2 (weight: 700):** Department-specific configurations  
- **Policy 3 (weight: 500):** Location-based settings

Higher-weight policies take precedence for conflicting settings, enabling modular device management without complex policy sprawl.

**Device Audiences - Smart dynamic segmentation**

Meraki SM limitation: Static groups requiring manual management
Applivery capability: **Dynamic audiences based on device attributes**

Create intelligent device segments that update automatically:
- **Example 1:** "Android devices running OS version < 12 in Sales department"
- **Example 2:** "iOS devices enrolled via DEP with battery health < 80%"
- **Example 3:** "Windows laptops used by remote workers in EMEA region"

Devices automatically join/leave audiences as their attributes change, eliminating manual group management.

**Automation Rules - Event-triggered actions**

Meraki SM limitation: No automation capabilities
Applivery capability: **Event-driven workflow automation**

Set up automatic actions triggered by specific events:
- **"When device joins Management Team audience → Apply Executive Policy"**
- **"When certificate expires in 10 days → Trigger renewal process"**
- **"When device battery health drops below 70% → Send replacement alert"**
- **"When iOS device updates to new OS version → Adjust policy restrictions"**

Automation Rules eliminate repetitive manual tasks and ensure policies apply instantly based on device state.

**Interpolation - Dynamic variables in policies**

Meraki SM limitation: Static policy values only
Applivery capability: **Reference device/user attributes dynamically**

Insert dynamic values directly into policies for personalized deployments:
- **Device name:** `{device.name}` - "John's MacBook Pro"
- **User email:** `{user.email}` - Configure VPN with user's email address
- **Custom attributes:** `{custom.department}` - Department-specific configurations

Deploy one policy template that personalizes automatically for each device, eliminating the need for hundreds of static policies.

**Comparison: Meraki SM vs. Applivery Automation**

| Capability | Meraki SM | Applivery | Improvement |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Policies per device | 1 | Unlimited (weighted) | ∞ |
| Dynamic device groups | Basic static groups | Smart audiences with auto-update | 10x more flexible |
| Event automation | None | Event-triggered rules | Revolutionary |
| Dynamic policy values | None | Full interpolation support | Game-changing |
| Setup complexity | Moderate | Minimal | 5x faster |

### 3. Transparent pricing - Save 40% compared to Meraki SM

Applivery offers simple, predictable pricing with no hidden costs or complex licensing structures.

**Applivery pricing:**

## Common Meraki SM migration questions answered

### When should I start my migration from Meraki SM?

**Now.** With Meraki SM end-of-support on December 31, 2025, and complete shutdown on March 31, 2026, you have limited time to plan and execute a smooth migration.

**Recommended timeline:**
- **12+ months remaining:** Ideal—plan thoroughly, optimize vendor selection
- **6-12 months remaining:** Good—begin immediately, adequate time for thorough migration
- **3-6 months remaining:** Urgent—fast-track vendor selection, accelerate migration
- **<3 months remaining:** Critical—emergency migration required, contact Applivery immediately

Organizations starting now can complete migration in 2-4 weeks with Applivery's streamlined process.

### Will my devices lose management during migration?

**No.** Applivery supports zero-downtime migration with devices remaining managed throughout the transition.

**Migration approach:**
1. Devices remain enrolled in Meraki SM during pilot phase
2. Batch migration occurs over 1-2 weeks
3. Each device unenrolled from Meraki SM and immediately enrolled in Applivery
4. Gap between platforms: typically 5-15 minutes per device
5. Users experience minimal disruption

**For extra safety:** Migrate during low-risk periods (weekends, after-hours, during slow business periods).

### Can I test Applivery before committing to migration?

**Yes.** Applivery offers a 14-day free trial with full Enterprise feature access—no credit card required.

**What you can test:**

### What happens to my Meraki network integration?

Applivery is **network-agnostic** and works with any network infrastructure, including Meraki networks.

**If you use Meraki networking:**
- Applivery integrates via API for network-based actions
- All device management happens in Applivery
- Network policies remain in Meraki Dashboard
- Best of both worlds: Meraki for networking, Applivery for device management

**If you're considering replacing Meraki networking:**
- Applivery works perfectly with any networking vendor
- No vendor lock-in or dependencies
- Choose best-in-class solutions independently

### How long does Applivery migration take?

**Average: 2-4 weeks total** from signup to complete migration.

**Detailed timeline:**
- Week 1: Platform setup, policy migration, pilot preparation
- Week 2: Pilot with 50-100 devices, feedback and refinement
- Week 3-4: Full migration in batches, all devices enrolled

**Factors that affect timeline:**
- Total device count (1,000+ devices may add 1-2 weeks)
- Policy complexity (more complex policies need more setup time)
- IT team availability (dedicated team vs. part-time)
- User readiness (tech-savvy users vs. extensive training needs)

**Fastest migration on record:** 3 weeks for 800 devices
**Typical enterprise migration:** 4-6 weeks for 2,000+ devices

### What if I have custom Meraki SM integrations?

Applivery provides a **comprehensive REST API** that exceeds Meraki SM capabilities, making it easy to replicate or improve your integrations.

**Migration approach:**
1. Document existing Meraki SM integrations
2. Review Applivery API documentation
3. Replicate integrations using Applivery API
4. Test integrations during pilot phase
5. Activate integrations during full migration

**Applivery advantages:**
- More powerful API with 10,000 requests/hour
- 50+ webhook events for real-time notifications
- Better documentation with code examples
- Native integrations with popular platforms

**Need help?** Applivery migration services include integration planning and development support.

### Can I migrate devices gradually or must I do all at once?

**Gradual migration is recommended** and supported by Applivery.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Pilot: 50-100 devices (Week 2)
2. Early majority: 20% of fleet (Week 3)

**Benefits of gradual migration:**
- Minimize risk of widespread issues
- Learn and optimize with each batch
