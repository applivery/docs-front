Greetings, Applivery users! We're beyond excited to unveil our October 2025 update—one of the most transformative releases in our platform's history. This update introduces groundbreaking automation capabilities, intelligent fleet management, and unprecedented customization options that put you in complete control of your device ecosystem. Whether you're managing 10 devices or 10,000, these features will revolutionize how you deploy, manage, and optimize your mobile fleet. Let's dive into what's new!

**Quick notes before we start:**

- Interpolation creates smarter, more flexible templates for deployment, reducing manual work while increasing personalization
- Policy Composition fundamentally changes settings management by enabling multiple policies per device with weighted priority (example: Policy 1 for company-wide restrictions, Policy 2 for user-specific configurations, Policy 3 for behavior-based customization)
- Device Audiences enable management at scale rather than device-by-device, perfect for targeted deployments and safer phased rollouts
- Automation Rules work as the perfect companion to Device Audiences, enabling workflows like "When device joins Management Team Audience, automatically apply Executive Policy" or "When certificate is 10 days from expiring, trigger renewal process"
- Advanced Certificate Management requires connection to custom Certificate provider and is available by contacting Customer Success Manager for Enterprise customers
- Visual customization features provide complete control over how devices look and feel for end users
- Startup Apps feature is a significant time-saver for setup workflows, guiding users through critical initial setup automatically
- Custom Footer in Advanced Launcher adds persistent information layer with dynamic variables for enhanced device identification
- **Enterprise Plan features** (Policy Composition, Device Audiences, Automation Rules, Advanced Certificate Management) are in private access—contact Customer Success Manager for activation

### 🚀 New Features & Enhancements

- **Interpolation (Now Generally Available)**: Dynamic value replacement for device names, user details, and custom attributes directly within configurations and policies. Deploy personalized settings at scale without manual configuration—let the platform do the heavy lifting for you
- **Policy Composition (Enterprise Plans - Private Access)**: Say goodbye to single-policy limitations! Apply multiple overlapping policies per device with a weighted priority system (1-1000) for granular control. Stack company-wide policies with team-specific rules and individual customizations seamlessly
- **Device Audiences (Enterprise Plans - Private Access)**: Smart fleet segmentation based on device or user properties like OS version, device model, enrollment type, or custom attributes. Perfect for targeted deployments, phased rollouts, and managing complex device ecosystems at scale
- **Automation Rules (Enterprise Plans - Private Access)**: Event-triggered automatic actions that work like magic. Automatically apply policies when devices join audiences, trigger certificate renewals when expiration approaches, and create sophisticated workflows without manual intervention
- **Advanced Certificate Management (Enterprise Plans - Private Access)**: New infrastructure component allows connection to custom Certificate providers for fully automated certificate issuing and renewal. Never worry about expired certificates again
- **Visual & Display Configuration**: Complete control over device appearance including wallpaper settings, icon size adjustments, app layout organization, folder creation, and display options like forcing screen-on for kiosk/POS scenarios
- **Startup Apps Configuration**: Designate specific apps to automatically launch on first installation, guiding users through critical initial setup workflows without confusion or support tickets
- **Custom Footer for Advanced Launcher**: Add a persistent footer with customizable text, font size, and dynamic variable insertion (device name, user email, etc.) for enhanced device identification and user guidance

### 🔄 Changes & Improvements

- **Platform Architecture Overhaul**: Completely redesigned Device Management backend engine delivering powerful targeted automation and enhanced control capabilities that set the foundation for future innovations
