# Overview

Module 1 establishes the conceptual and technical foundation of Unified Endpoint Management (UEM). It explains what endpoints are, how they are categorized, the types of devices managed in enterprise environments, the main corporate use cases (BYOD, COPE, CYOD, COBO), and the modern challenges organizations face around diversity, scalability, security, and automation.

The module provides both theoretical understanding and practical context for how Applivery addresses each concept through its **API-first architecture**, **agent-based extensions**, and **unified management model**.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this module, you will be able to:

* Define the concept of an endpoint and differentiate it from a traditional device
* Describe the evolution from Device Management to Endpoint Management
* Identify the main types of devices manageable under a UEM framework
* Distinguish among BYOD, COPE, CYOD, and COBO enterprise models
* Recognize the modern challenges of diversity, scalability, security, and automation
* Explain how Applivery's platform uniquely addresses these challenges through its design and capabilities

## Module Structure

This module consists of 5 progressive lessons:

1. **What is an Endpoint?** - Understanding the foundation of endpoint management
2. **Evolution from Device Management to Endpoint Management** - How we got here
3. **Types of Manageable Devices** - The diversity of endpoints in modern organizations
4. **Enterprise Use Cases and Ownership Models** - BYOD, COPE, CYOD, and COBO explained
5. **Modern Challenges in Endpoint Management** - Addressing diversity, scale, security, and automation

## Applivery's Approach

Throughout this module, you'll discover Applivery's unique strengths:

* **API-First Integration:** leveraging native OS management APIs (Apple, Android, Windows) for deep, reliable control
* **Hybrid Agent Model:** extending management capabilities beyond API limitations with real-time telemetry and automation
* **Unified Inventory and Compliance Engine:** centralizing data, policies, and visibility across all endpoints
* **Scalability and Automation:** delivering elasticity through cloud-native design, Automation Rules, and dynamic device grouping
