Greetings, Applivery users! We're excited to bring you our comprehensive November update packed with powerful new features and optimizations. This release focuses on giving you more control over device management, streamlining your app distribution workflow, and enhancing security across your mobile fleet. Let's dive in!

**Quick notes before we start:**

- Scheduled sync configuration available in Device Management > Settings > Apple Configuration section
- Manual commands and forced updates remain available even during scheduled offline windows
- Device inventory supports full lifecycle tracking from acquisition to decommissioning including updates, repairs, and relocations
- Build attachments streamline workflows by keeping all documentation readily available throughout the app distribution process
- **Important:** API domain migration requires configuration updates before January 31 deadline to avoid service disruption

### 🚀 New Features & Enhancements

- **Scheduled Sync for Apple Devices**: Set calendar-based time windows where devices won't communicate with Applivery—perfect for managing syncs during off-peak hours while maintaining the ability to send manual commands when needed
- **Device Inventory Management**: Automatic device registration upon enrollment with CSV import support for unregistered devices, automatic updates, centralized data storage, detailed lifecycle tracking, and resource optimization capabilities
- **Build Attachments**: Upload additional files like release notes and troubleshooting guides directly to your builds for better documentation organization and seamless team communication
- **Keystore to JKS Conversion Tool**: Easily convert Android Keystore files to Java Keystore (JKS) format using the keytool command—no more compatibility headaches
- **EULA Support for macOS**: Present legal documents during device login with automatic enforcement through policy configuration, ensuring compliance from day one

### 🔄 Changes & Improvements

- **API Domain Migration**: App Distribution API has migrated from `api.applivery.io` to `upload.applivery.io` for improved infrastructure, faster performance, and more secure integrations. Don't forget to update your configurations before the old domain deactivates on January 31, 2025!
